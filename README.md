Mission Mars!!

Story Behind the game:

Few astronauts went to mars to know about life on the mars and found a valuable artifact named martian artifact that would be very helpful for the research about life on mars. But while bringing it back to earth, Aliens abducted and killed them and then placed the martian artifact in martian vault. Now new Mission Mars was initiated where the main goal of our player is to search and get the martian artifact to earth.

Here, game starts by landing player on mars landing site. Goal of the mission is to search and get the martian artifact to earth in order to win the game.

Initially game starts at landing site where player gets out from space craft on landing site. Now, landing site has supply room to its south where it has oxygen tank, torch light which can be used to proceed further. To the east of supply room, there is an equipment room that has base station key. Equipment storage is dark, you need torchlight to move ahead and take the key. To the west of supply room, there is a weapon room which has weapons to kill the alien. Then to south of Supply room, there is a base station which requires a key to unlock otherwise way is blocked. Once after entering base station, there is an alien which has passcode of martian vault. We need to defeat alien in order to get the passcode. Once after getting the passcode, we have martian vault to the south of base station. We can open the vault using the passcode and collect the artifact. Once after collecting artifact we win the game and to get to back earth.

Meanwhile while playing the game, every item collected or taken should be in player inventory. And also, initial oxygen level is 100%, each move in any direction would reduce oxygen by 15% and oxygen level is checked at each move and when oxygen level is less than or equal to 10% the player should have oxygen tank in his inventory to refill otherwise game is over.

WHY NOT MARS????â€¨

Being very much interested in space and alien stuff, we chose to create a game that matches the real world scenario where a lot research is going on to find out about life on mars. And also, it would be a great game to develop into a real time action game with UI/UX design.# IF_and_Text_generation
